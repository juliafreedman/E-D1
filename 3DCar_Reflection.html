	     <p><i> This is a reflection of the work I did with 3D modeling. The fourth project in Engineering and Design I was to create a replica of a toy car 	using a computer-aided design program called Onshape and the 3D printer.
              We started from a 2D drawing, created each profile of the car in a 2D plane, and then finally added finishing touches on the 3D car.  </i></p>


	<h3> Guidelines: </h3>
	  <p> The guidelines of this project were to create an engineering drawing of a toy car, and 	use this as a foundation to render a design in Onshape. </p>

	<h3>Project Steps: </h3>
	<p> The steps were as follows: </p>
	<ul>
		<li> Take measurements </li>
        <ul>  <li> Using calipers, measure the width, length, and height of the car. </li> </ul>
		<li> Render an Engineering Drawing</li>
        <ul>  <li> Create an engineering drawing using the measurements. </li> </ul>
        <ul>  <li> Sketch each profile of the car: front profile, side profile, and top profile. </li> </ul>
        <ul>  <li> Sketch the 3D envelope </li> </ul>
		<li> Design </li>
        <ul>  <li> In Onshape, design the 3D model </li> </ul>
        <ul>  <li> Add Detailing </li> </ul>
		<li> Fabricate </li>
        <ul>  <li> Prepare file for 3D printing </li> </ul>
        <ul>  <li> Print Model </li> </ul>
		<li> Render a CAD Drawing </li>
        <ul>  <li> Calculate margin of error  </li> </ul>
		<li> Capture/Archive </li>
        <ul>  <li> Take photos of the engineering drawing, CAD Drawing and upload to Github </li> </ul>
        <ul>  <li> Take photos of your 3D model </li> </ul>
	</ul>

	<h3> The process:  </h3>
	<p> I started the design process by choosing a toy car, and, using calipers, took
    	measurements of the width, length, and height. I then created an engineering drawing of each
      profile of the car to scale (or as close as possible). The three profiles of the car are the 	top view, or the xy plane,
      the side view, or the xz plane, and the front view, or the yz 	plane. We also created rectangular prism, or 3D envelope,
      that encapsulated the car, and 	labelled the appropriate sides X, Y, and  Z. In Onshape, this 3D envelope was first created
      with the appropriate measurements, and then images of each profile drawing was imported on 	the corresponding side of the
      envelope. We used the pen tool to outline these sketches, and 	then removed the negative space to create a first draft
      of the 3D car. We then refined the 	car by filletting, or rounding, any sharp edges, creating wheels that extrude from the car,
      and any other asthetic details. We then imported this design into Ultimaker Cura, a 3D
      printing program, and added any necessary support to the car. After printing the car, a CAD
      drawing was rendered to show clearly measurements of the car and any necessary details like
      angle of the windshield, so the project could be replicated. We calculated the margin of
      error, and scanned and archived to Github.  </p>

	<h3>Challenges, setbacks, and solutions: </h3>
	 <p> This project was the most technical yet, and required more engineering skills. One challenge of the project was familiarizing myself with Onshape.
     At first, the program was very tricky and I did not know how to create new sketches, zoom, or move my design. However, I feel more confident after this project.
     My first setback was using the pen tool to draw my design in Onshape from the template of my sketch. I did not make my
     sketch very accurate. The profiles did not align, and the sketched lines were not precise.
     I solved this problem by addressing the misalignment. I had to decrease the height and the length of my car, which
     created a larger margin of error, but it still resulted in a car that resembled the original. I also did not draw my wheels evenly or precisely in my engineering drawing, which resulted in
     wheels that were slightly different sizes. If I were to do this project again, I would ensure to make a precise and to-scale engineering drawing.
